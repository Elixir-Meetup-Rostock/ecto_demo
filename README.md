# EctoDemo
This is mostly a barebones Phoenix project to demonstrate basic Ecto functionality. There is a livebook in livebook/ecto_schulung.livemd that provides a rough guideline for an initial ecto teaching session. To view, install livebook separately from [livebook.dev](https://livebook.dev).


## Basic Phoenix Readme

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
